## Web Audio

#### Brief History

- [bgsound](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/bgsound) html element (deprecated)
- [embed](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/embed) html element for multimedia
- Adobe Flash Player [(deprecated)](https://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/end-of-life-alternative.html) allowed for more precise manipulation of sound
- [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) allows for loading & manipulating sound files without using plugins, as well as more complex sound processing

## Functions

#### You've been using functions this whole time
- A functions is a block of code that is executed when something "calls" it
- They take some input and provide some output
- Calling a function will execute the procedure defined with any indicated parameters, then continue to execute the next piece of code
- Callback functions are passed into another function as an argument

#### Defining your own functions
- Useful once you want to execute the same code more than once
- By abstracting re-used areas of code, you can make your code more modular
- Parameters provide flexibility, based on where you want to add variation in your function
- Parameters are variables created when the function runs
- You can use functions to return a value to the main program
- Like with variables, function names should be unique and descriptive

#### Loading & Playing Sound
- [loadSound()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/loadSound)
- filesize limited in the p5.js web editor is 5MB

## Assignment
- Pick one:
    - Refactor a previous assignment using the abstraction & modularity methods we've been covering (variables, loops, functions).
    - Define at least one function and use it in a loop. Use iterations in the loop to vary the arguments to your function.
- Add a link to the [homework wiki](https://github.com/jfunky/diap-creativecomputing-fall2022/wiki/Homework).
