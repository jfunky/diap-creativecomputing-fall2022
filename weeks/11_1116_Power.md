## [Transistors & Relays](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/electronics/transistors-relays-and-controlling-high-current-loads/)
- **Anytime you use something that requires more power than the arduino supplies, you need a transistor**
- A [Transistor](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/transistors/all) is like an electronic switch often used to have a small amount of energy (an electronic signal) control a larger amount of energy
    - Transistors have three terminals 
        - Bi-polar junction transistor (BJT) have terminals called:
            - collector (connects to V+)
            - base (responsible for activating flow from the collector to emitter)
            - emitter (connects to ground)
        - For MOSFETS (Metal Oxide Field Effect Transistor)
            - source (connects to ground)
            - gate (responsible for activating flow from the source to drain)
            - drain (connects to V+)
- Relays are mechanical switches, which similarly can be used to control a large amount of energy with a small amount of energy
    - Relays are purely on/off devices, which means they can't map a proportional load but they are good for systems that have to be completely isolated
    - Because they are mechanical, they operate more slowly than transistors (but still 20x+ faster than a human operating a switch)
    - While technically some transistors can be used with AC current, typically a relay will be used 

## [Motors](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/dc-motors-the-basics/)
- Motors (and relays, and solenoids) are indusctive loads
- Properties of motors include Torque & Speed (in addition to Voltage, Current, Resistance, like all other electrical components we've used)
- **Torque** is the measure of a motor's ability to move weight, or "movement force." Torque is included on motors' datasheets in units like mass/"some distance" (ie pounds/feet)
    - "Holding torque" is the ability of a motor to withstand force when stopped, but energized
- **Speed** is the measure of how quickly a motor spins, in "rotations per minute" (rpm)
- Motors are designed for continuous motion
    - They will work within 40-50% of their rated voltage, which can be useful for testing
    - Motors will draw more current when they start, to overcome intertia
    - Motors (like any inductive load) may also create a reverse voltage when turned off, which is why you will see circuits with protection diodes
    - Typically motors don't provide feedback (how far they've turned, angle, etc)
- If you want to control speed and direction, you should use a motor driver like an [H-Bridge](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/315) or [EasyDriver](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12779)
- Servo motors do provide feedback about rotation and angle. For other motors, you can get this feedback with a sensor
- You can find good junk motors in things like tape decks, CD players, record players, blenders, drills--lots of appliances have motors!
- **Anytime you use something that requires more power than the arduino supplies, you need a transistor**

#### [Controlling a DC Motor with a Transistor](https://learn.adafruit.com/experimenters-guide-for-metro/circ03-intro)
- With this circuit, you are limited to spinning in one direction
- For DC motors, torque & speed are inversely related: they will spin fast when they have no load and will slow down as output torque increases

#### [Controlling a Servo Motor](https://learn.adafruit.com/experimenters-guide-for-metro/circ04-intro)
- Servo motors (like Stepper motors) are more commonly used for applications that require more torque but capabilities will depend on the motor
- Servo motors have the benefit of being programmable by angle/position
- Gearboxes can be used to add significantly more torque to your system
