## Review

- What are remaining questions about:
  - Data types
  - Objects
  - Media
- Let's finally review [interactive text](https://github.com/jfunky/diap-creativecomputing-fall2022/blob/main/weeks/03_0914_Conditionals.md) and the [color theory readings](https://programmingdesignsystems.com/color/a-short-history-of-color-theory/index.html)

## DOM

- The (HTML) [Document Object Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction) is the representation of a webpage, how your browser knows what and how to render content
- HTML
  - HTML markup: system of nested tags
  - Elements (like the p5.js canvas)
  - Attributes: additional info about elements (source url, unique identifiers)
  - Tree structure: root node with subsequent nodes defined by tags
- CSS
  - Separation of style & content
  - Link elements to styling (blank space, colors, alignment, grid) through identifiers (HTML id, class)
- Javascript
  - All modern web browsers have a javascript engine that allows for interaction with the content on a webpage

### Interacting with the DOM using p5.js

- You can generate HTML elements
- You can add CSS proprerties
- And you can "bind" events to new or existing DOM elements
- [p5.js DOM reference](https://p5js.org/reference/#group-DOM)

## Assignment
- Pick one:
  - Create a sketch (or build on an existing sketch) where something unexpected happens
  - Create a simple prototype for an interaction you are perhaps interested in exploring through the rest of this semester
  - Implement a technique you haven't tried yet
