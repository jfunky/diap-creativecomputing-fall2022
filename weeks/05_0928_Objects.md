## Video Games

#### Notes

- Video games evolved alongside computation and computational graphics
  - Mainframe computers, to console market, internet, mobile, VR
  - Optical media, to 3D graphics, ray-tracing and photorealism
- Tenuous recognition as their own art form
  - Originally viewed as toys for kids, but have evolved
  - Necessarily collaborative with creative elements, but sometimes driven by large corporations and sometimes independent developers
- Piracy or preservation?
  - Rise of emulators and enthusiasts distributing deprecated games
  - The challenge of digital archiving of media art, complicated by complex licensing and the nature of video game collection by individuals (as opposed to institutions)

## Object Oriented Programming

- Objects in software are a way to group variables with related functions into a cohesive module
- Objects have properties (variables) and methods (functions)
- A class is like a template, or blueprint, for objects
  - Some methaphors: if a human were an object, properties may be: height, eye color and methods may be: walk, sleep
- Object-oriented programming OOP organizes a program with objects and methods as the main elements, while Functional programming uses variables and functions in a procedural way

#### Defining a Class

- Like with functions and variables, class names should be unique (not a class name that already exists) and descriptive
- The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with a class
- You can only define one constructor method within a class

#### Instantiating an Object

- Once defined, you can instantiate an object using the keyword: new
- Each instance of an object will have the properties defined in the class with any values passed through on instantiation, as well as all associated methods

## Assignment

Pick one:
1. Refactor a previous assignment in an object oriented way
2. Define at least one class use it to instantiate several objects
- As a stretch goal for either assignment, create an array of objects and a parallel array where you call its method(s)
- Add a link **and a question** to the [homework wiki](https://github.com/jfunky/diap-creativecomputing-fall2022/wiki/Homework)
