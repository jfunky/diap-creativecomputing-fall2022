## Interactive Text

#### Notes

- What differentiates interactive narrative/storytelling from other interactive media? 
- Maintenance of dramatic structure + user agency to varying degrees
- Fiction & non-fiction
- Text-based games & text adventures
- Can leverage natural language processing for generative text
- [Twine](https://twinery.org/) is an Open Source platform for non-linear, interactive stories

## [Program Flow](https://p5js.org/learn/program-flow.html)

#### if/else conditional statements
- if statements allow you to control whether a piece of code runs based on whether a particular statement resolves to true (or false)
  - syntax includes the test statement followed by a block of code in brackets {}
- else statements allow you to explicitly state what code should run when the if statement is false
- else if statements allow you to test a new condition when your if statement is false
- if/else used together can have some efficiencies
- Combining variables with conditional statements: this may seem trivial but comes will challenge you to understand order of operations in your program, when to create a new variable, understanding and planning ahead for what needs to vary and where you should update a value

#### Loops

- The draw loop is one way to incorporate temporal repetition that you can take advantage of
- Loops execute a block of code repeatedly (while some test condition is true)
  - When there is no exit condition, this results in an infinite loop
- We will look at the syntax for different kinds of loops in Javascript:
  - for: specifies the number of times the loop runs
  - for/in: used for looping through objects
  - while: loops while a condition is true
  - do/while: loops while a condition is true

#### [Text](https://p5js.org/reference/#group-Typography)

- Drawing text with [text()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/text) function
- Attributes allow you to change the color, stroke, load custom fonts
- These are p5-specific functions but you can also use HTML/CSS

## Assignment

- Create a new sketch or build on your sketch from last week, where you incorporate repetition using a loop. The end result could be a geometric design or pattern, a motif, a color gradient, text etc.
  - Stretch goals: incorporate interaction or text.
- Add a link to the [homework wiki](https://github.com/jfunky/diap-creativecomputing-fall2022/wiki/Homework).
