  - **Personal safety & Multimeter care notes:**
    * Never try to read resistance or continuity with a multimeter on a circuit that is energized
    * Measuring voltage (voltage is measured in parallel) with settings meant to measure current will likely blow your multimeterâ€™s fuse 
    * Take extra care when measuring high current or AC voltage - connect probs with one hand at a time
